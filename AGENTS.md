# AGENTS

This repository is maintained through story-driven branches.

## Delivery Rules

- Branch naming: `feat/SC-<id>`.
- Every story must run `make lint` and `make test`.
- PR titles use `<type>[SC-<id>] <title>` where `<type>` is `feat`, `chore`, or `bug`.
- Do not merge story branches automatically.
